# Music-Genre-Suggester
This program takes a data set of age, gender and music taste and recommends genres of music that others may enjoy based on the data set provided

## Inspiration for the project
For my introduction to machine learning project, I opted to create a practical application that can eventually serve as a useful tool to help music enthusiasts discover their preferred music genres. I found the idea intriguing and decided to use this opportunity to expand my knowledge and proficiency in using two popular open-source data analysis libraries, namely pandas and Scikit-learn. This project has proven to be an excellent learning experience, allowing me to apply my newly acquired skills in a practical and meaningful way.

This program pulls from the csv file provided to predict what genres of music users may enjoy given their age and gender. 0 and 1 represent the genders of male and female respectively.
